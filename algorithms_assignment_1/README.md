## 🧪 Assignment Overview

### 🔍 Problem Definition
The task is to **implement and compare four sorting algorithms** on datasets of varying sizes and conditions (random, sorted, and reverse sorted).

### ✨ Implemented Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Pigeonhole Sort
- Counting Sort

### 🔧 Implementation Details
- Each algorithm is implemented from scratch in Java.
- Array handling and performance optimization improvements were made.
- Pseudocode-based implementation with practical enhancements.

---

## 📊 Performance Results

Each algorithm was tested across input sizes ranging from `512` to `251281` elements.

**Test Cases:**
- Random input data
- Sorted input data
- Reverse sorted input data

**Results include:**
- Execution time tables
- Graphs showing performance trends
- Best/Average/Worst-case time complexity
- Auxiliary space usage

---

## 📈 Summary

- **Insertion Sort** is optimal for already sorted data.
- **Merge Sort** performs best overall with consistent `O(n log n)` time.
- **Pigeonhole & Counting Sort** are faster on random/reverse data but inefficient on sorted inputs.
- Graphs and tables back up theoretical complexity with empirical results.
