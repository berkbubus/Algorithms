## 📘 Assignments Summary

### 🔢 PA1 – Sorting Algorithms and Performance Analysis
- Implemented and compared:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Pigeonhole Sort
- Tested across datasets of different sizes and orders (random, sorted, reverse).
- Analyzed and graphed:
  - Runtime
  - Space complexity
  - Best/average/worst case behavior

---

### 🌌 PA2 – Hashing, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Methods
- Mission-style simulation with 3 parts:
  - **Firewall (Hashing):** Malware detection via custom hashing
  - **Nuke’m (DP):** Optimize weapon usage over time
  - **Exterminate (Greedy):** Bomb loading into AUAVs

---

### 🛰️ PA3 – Graph Algorithms: Topological Sort, Connected Components, MST
- **Mission Groundwork:** Topological sort for task scheduling
- **Mission Exploration:** Discover solar systems via connected components
- **Mission Networking:** Use MST to build cost-efficient communication networks

---

### 🌐 PA4 – Shortest Path Algorithms & Dynamic Network Management
- Built a simulation of departmental computer network routers.
- Parsed corrupted network files via regular expressions.
- Calculated routing tables using shortest paths.
- Supported dynamic updates (add/remove router/link, router failures).
